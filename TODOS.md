# **To-Dos/Issues**:

- The ability to change X-origin/Y-origin (pivot points) for any view

- Remove views from entities (groups) as well.

- It should respect forces added to x, y positions of any entitiy, for more accurate collision. Maybe, pass any added forces to the collision function or get p2 - p1 / to get the velocity.

- A function that prints the docs for `qKit`.

- The ability to create multiple sprite sheets.

- Consider destructuring config objects.

- The ability to have a function that enables/disables listeners.

- A faster searching algorithms.

- Use ```strict mode```.

- Maybe, implement fixed/variable time in update.

- Needs more info for the screen object.

- Use ```object.prototype``` rather than ```this``` to add new functions to an object.

- The ability to change the screen's settings, after ```qKit.init()``` has been called.

- More sound controls: pause, resume, stop, ... etc.

- Store views in dictionary rather than an array for faster access.
